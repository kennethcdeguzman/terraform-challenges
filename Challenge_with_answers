1. Create a container named "my_nginx_container", with the docker image "nginx:latest"
	
2. Attach network "my_network" to your container
	* verify your current terraform setup with
	
	 - $terraform show
	
	* verify your container is attached to your network
	
	 - $docker inspect <container-name> -f "{{json .NetworkSettings.Networks}}"

3. copy index.html to your home project folder
	* Create a volume block with the container path going to "/usr/share/nginx/html", and the path to the host going to the dir where your index.html is residing

4. destroy all your terraform resources

5. Display your current terraform workspace
	- $ terraform workspace show
	* Create 2 terraform workspaces (dev, test)
	- $ terraform workspace new dev
	- $ terraform workspace new test

6. Create a variable block named "nginx_container_conf" type "map(map(string))"
	* under default map create 2 keys (test, dev)
	* under each keys(test,dev) create 2 key value maps
		dev = {
      		name = "nginx-dev"
      		external_port = "8080"
    	}

    	test = {
      		name = "nginx-test"
      		external_port = "8081"
    	}
    * in your "docker_container" block, set the container name to lookup the name value of whatever terraform workspace you're currently at, in your "nginx_container_conf" variable block
    * in your "docker_container" block, set the container external port to lookup the external_port value of whatever terraform workspace you're currently at, in your "nginx_container_conf" variable block
